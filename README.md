# Transformer-based Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

In this project, I implemented a Transformer-based model tailored for sentiment analysis on social media content, such as tweets. Leveraging the attention mechanism, the model efficiently captures context-aware representations for each word in the input, striving for state-of-the-art performance in sentiment classification tasks.

Inspired by the seminal paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., I developed this solution from scratch, ensuring a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and a flexible architecture for possible enhancements.

## Features

- **Transformer Architecture**: Harnesses the transformer architecture, allowing the model to consider the context of other words in the input when encoding a specific word.
  
- **Positional Encoding**: Infuses the model with information about the position of words in the input.
  
- **Custom Tokenization**: I implemented a custom tokenization process particularly suited for social media content.
  
- **End-to-End Training and Evaluation**: Comprehensive training and evaluation routines, equipped with logging capabilities for keen insights into the model's performance.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:bat0001/Transformer-based-Sentiment-Analysis.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd transformer-sentiment-analysis

3. **Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

**To train the model:
   ```bash
   python main.py
```


This script orchestrates the data preparation, trains the model on the supplied dataset, and assesses its performance on a test subset.

## Results

This Transformer-based approach to sentiment analysis has shown promising results in initial tests. The attention mechanism endows the model with a significant advantage over traditional deep learning techniques, especially in contexts where discerning the relationship between disparate parts of the text is pivotal.
